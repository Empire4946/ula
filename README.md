# ula5.1
Lua5.1 but some of it commands/functions are renamed for easier and faster usage.

## what is the point of this?
ula is kinda like an addon, its purpose is to make programmers much more faster thus making scripts update faster.

### Open Source Policy
ula is open-source but claiming to do the functions/commands themselves would get you in big trouble. I literally put effort into adding simple commands and you guys are just gonna steal it?! what the fork man.
